# Welcome!
this is pet project for managing svg files inside of a web ui.

it's messy (first real project)

this started as a learning project. I'm about 3years in and I'm ready to learn new things, meet new people and see where it takes me.
I'm still new to all of this so if you see something that piques your interest, or notice something I can learn from pretty please reach out on twitter!

I want feedback, I want to make friends in the industry, I want to learn from others, I want to hear from you!
